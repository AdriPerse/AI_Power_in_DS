    "This code snippet should create the GIF as you specified. Note that the rotate function in PIL doesn't directly support specifying the center of rotation, so the rotation will be around the center of the image. To rotate around a different point, you would need to shift the image so that the point of rotation is at the center, rotate the image, and then shift the image back. This would require additional processing and might complicate the code."
